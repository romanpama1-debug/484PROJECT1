This gallery shows a few images that represent creativity, technology, 
and inspiration. Each picture connects to the theme of learning web 
development and building projects step-by-step. These visuals help make 
the site more engaging while demonstrating how images and layouts work together.

This image represents creativity and modern digital media. 
Music, art, and design often inspire website layouts, colors, and 
visual styles. Including creative content helps make web pages feel 
more dynamic and engaging.
</p>

<p>
Adding images like this also demonstrates how layouts can combine 
pictures and text side-by-side using CSS grid and flexbox techniques.

This website was created as a practice project to demonstrate the basics 
of HTML structure, navigation, and CSS styling. The goal of this project 
is to show how a simple layout can grow into a full website by adding 
new pages, images, and interactive features over time.
</p>

<p>
While building this site, I learned how to organize content using 
semantic HTML elements, create consistent page layouts, and style 
content using CSS. This project represents the first step toward 
building more advanced and responsive websites in the future.
