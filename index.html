        This website is a practice project created to demonstrate basic HTML structure, navigation, and styling using CSS. The goal of this page is to show how a simple
layout can grow into a full website by adding new pages, images, and interactive
features over time. As you explore the site, you will see examples of headings,
navigation menus, and content sections working together to create a clear and
organized user experience.
</p>

<p>
Web development combines creativity and problem-solving. By learning how HTML
structures content and how CSS controls appearance, we can design pages that are
both functional and visually appealing. This project is the first step toward
building more advanced and responsive websites.
